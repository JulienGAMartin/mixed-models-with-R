This folder contains all you need to get started with the Mixed Model workshop.  It contains the following:

- *data/*: Data folder containing *.RData files that contain the data used in examples and/or exercises (and some others).
- *starter.Rmd/html*: A starter script to get you going with the examples used in the document, and exercises.
- *exercises.Rmd/html*: The exercises.
- *slim_review.Rmd/html*: A R notebook with a demo for linear regression.  This is the bare minimum required for following the workshop syntax.

You can first get your bearings by doing a brief review of linear regression with R. Open the slim_review.Rmd file, it may require you to install additional packages, and if so install them. 

Once we're done with that, open the starter file, and you're all set for the remainder of the workshop. You can refer to the exercises.html document when we get to them.
