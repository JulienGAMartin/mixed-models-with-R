# mixed-models-with-R

This document provides an introduction to mixed models. It uses <span class="pack">lme4</span> as the primary tool, but demonstrates others.  Topics include random intercept and slope models, discussion of crossed vs. nested random effects, some common extensions (e.g. generalized linear mixed models), Bayesian tools, and other models that deal with dependency in the data.
